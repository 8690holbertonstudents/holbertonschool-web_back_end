<h3>ES6 classes</h3>


<h5>0. You used to attend a place like this at some point</h5>

Implement a class named ClassRoom:

Prototype: export default class ClassRoom
It should accept one attribute named maxStudentsSize (Number) and assigned to _maxStudentsSize

<h5>1. Let's make some classrooms</h5>

Import the ClassRoom class from 0-classroom.js.

Implement a function named initializeRooms. It should return an array of 3 ClassRoom objects with the sizes 19, 20, and 34 (in this order).

<h5>2. A Course, Getters, and Setters</h5>

Implement a class named HolbertonCourse:

Constructor attributes:
name (String)
length (Number)
students (array of Strings)
Make sure to verify the type of attributes during object creation
Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
Implement a getter and setter for each attribute.

<h5>3. Methods, static methods, computed methods names..... MONEY</h5>

Implement a class named Currency:

- Constructor attributes:
code (String)
name (String)
Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
Implement a getter and setter for each attribute.
Implement a method named displayFullCurrency that will return the attributes in the following format name (code).

<h5>4. Pricing</h5>

Import the class Currency from 3-currency.js

Implement a class named Pricing:

Constructor attributes:
amount (Number)
currency (Currency)
Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
Implement a getter and setter for each attribute.
Implement a method named displayFullPrice that returns the attributes in the following format amount currency_name (currency_code).
Implement a static method named convertPrice. It should accept two arguments: amount (Number), conversionRate (Number). The function should return the amount multiplied by the conversion rate.


<h5>5. A Building</h5>

Implement a class named Building:

Constructor attributes:
sqft (Number)
Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
Implement a getter for each attribute.
Consider this class as an abstract class. And make sure that any class that extends from it should implement a method named evacuationWarningMessage.
If a class that extends from it does not have a evacuationWarningMessage method, throw an error with the message Class extending Building must override evacuationWarningMessage


<h5>6. Inheritance</h5>

Import Building from 5-building.js.

Implement a class named SkyHighBuilding that extends from Building:

Constructor attributes:
sqft (Number) (must be assigned to the parent class Building)
floors (Number)
Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
Implement a getter for each attribute.
Override the method named evacuationWarningMessage and return the following string Evacuate slowly the NUMBER_OF_FLOORS floors.



<h5>7. Airport</h5>

Implement a class named Airport:

Constructor attributes:
name (String)
code (String)
Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
The default string description of the class should return the airport code (example below).


<h5>8. Primitive - Holberton Class</h5>

Implement a class named HolbertonClass:

Constructor attributes:
size (Number)
location (String)
Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
When the class is cast into a Number, it should return the size.
When the class is cast into a String, it should return the location.


<h5>9. Hoisting</h5>

Fix this code and make it work.


<h5>10. Vroom</h5>

Implement a class named Car:

Constructor attributes:
brand (String)
motor (String)
color (String)
Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
Add a method named cloneCar. This method should return a new object of the class.
